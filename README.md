# restaurant-app
The primary purpose of this project is to design and implement a Point Of Sale (POS) system for a restaurant that would allow customers to use a device to place and modify food orders, provide games for children to play, call for help from the waitstaff or have drinks refilled, and let customers pay for their food.
